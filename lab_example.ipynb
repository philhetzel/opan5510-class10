    "You are interested in seeing the running total of strikes over time (`Collision Date and Time`) on a daily basis. Using the `strikes` dataframe, create a new column that removes the time information but keeps the date information from the `Collision Date and Time` column (call this new field `date`). Next, aggregate the `Number of Strikes` by day (call this new field `daily_strikes`). Sort the data in ascending order by `date`. Then, create the running total of `daily_strikes` (name the new field `strikes_cumulative`) and filter to only the records **up to and including** the `date` of 2013-12-31. Name the resulting data frame `running_total_strikes`.\n",

Using the `strikes` dataframe: sum the `Number of Strikes` measure by day (note: not by day and time). You can use a similar technique from Question 1 to create a new column from `Collision Date and Time` without time information and with date information (name this column `date`). Next, compute the previous day's strikes using a window function (name the new column `previous_day`), and calculate the difference of strikes between the current day and the previous day (name the new column `delta_strikes`). Sort the resulting data by `delta_strikes` in descending order to find which days had the highest increase of strikes from the previous day.
